## Overview 
This is a simple example showing how to send an image from TwinCAT using a Base64 bit encoded image.  Please note, there are limitations with how big the JSON can be.  Also, this is a proof of concept.  Displaying of images on TcHmi should be handled by the TwinCAT Vision Server Extension.
